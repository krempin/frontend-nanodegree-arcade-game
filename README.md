# Arcade Game

This is one of my projects for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. For the source code from Udacity, see the original repository.

## How to load the game

Clone this project or use the "download zip"-Button to Download the folder. Open "index.html" and the game will start immediately.

## How to play the game

Your goal is to reach the water, but ugly, mean bugs are preventing you from that. You have to pass the street and reach the water without getting catched by a bug!

Use the arrow key to move right, left, top and down.
